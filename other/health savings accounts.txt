When you are covered by an HSA-eligible health plan (also known as a high-deductible health plan or HDHP), you can open and contribute to a health savings account.

HSA-eligible health plans typically have lower premiums and a higher deductible, compared to traditional health plans. The HSA's multiple tax advantages may help offset that higher deductible.

If you change to a health plan that is not HSA-eligible, you can no longer contribute to your HSA, although you can still use the HSA money to pay for eligible medical expenses.

If you've used post-tax money to fund an HSA, use IRS Form 8889 to declare a deduction.
