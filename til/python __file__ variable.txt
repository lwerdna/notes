What is __file__?

https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html

example           value              invoked from
`./foo.py`        "/path/to/foo.py"  current directory
                  "/path/to/./foo.py called with ./foo.py
`/path/to/foo.py` "/path/to/foo.py"  different directory
`foo.py`          "/path/to/foo.py"  path

If foo.py is a symbolic link, __file__ will be the source side.
In other words, it will not resolve the link.
