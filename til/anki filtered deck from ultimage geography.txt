See "Custom Study" for ways to filter cards from this deck into a custom deck of your own.

I used this filter for middle east country identification:
  tag:UG::Middle_East ("card:Map - Country" OR "card:Country - Map")

And since Middle_East is a subset of Asia in UG, I used this for Asian countries:
  tag:UG::Asia -tag:UG::Middle_East ("card:Map - Country" OR "card:Country - Map")

Then Edit -> Create Filtered Deck
