-nostdlib
-nostartfiles
-nodefaultlibs

Why do files like libgcc_s.so show up anyways?
I deleted the file to find out.
Some other lib you link against (like libstdc++.so) can require it.
So provide -rpath, like `-Wl,-rpath,/path/to/libs` because `-Wl,aaa,bbb` to frontend turns into `aaa bbb` to linker.

`-v` to show more verbose output
`-Xlinker -t` to show temporary files and more stuff
`--save-temps` to keep temporary files around (files like /tmp/q8dfjwe.o)

-lstdc++ will find libstdc++.so.1.2.3.4 in the path specified by -L
