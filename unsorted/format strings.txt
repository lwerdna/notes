%u - unsigned int
%lu - unsigned long int
%llu - unsigned long long int
%zd - signed decimal [4] types: ssize_t, ptrdiff_t	 	
%zu - unsigned decimal types: size_t
%zX - unsigned hexadecimal size_t in hex, see [1] [3]
%zo - unsigned octal integer

1. size_t is usually typedef'd `unsigned int` but is only guaranteed to be an unsigned integer type. On 64-bit systems, `size_t` is `unsigned long` or `unsigned long long`, see [2].

2. `unsigned int` is no bigger than `unsigned long` which is no bigger than `unsigned long long`. On 32-bit machines, their respective sizes are 32, 32, and 64. On 64-bit machines, they're 32, 64, 64.

3. %z is a "length modifier" and was introduced in C99

4. The word "decimal" as an adjective just describes number systems and arithmetic based on the number ten, tength parts, and powers of ten. Not to be confused with a fraction expressed using a decimal point.

5. uintptr_t is an unsigned integer type guaranteed to be able to store a point. It neither a pointer to an int or an int containing a pointer.
