Find files:

  find . -name "*.py"
 
The -exec lets you put a command for each file. {} is substituted with the filename, and a ; (which must be escaped to avoid shell interpretation) ends the parameters to the command:

  find . -name "*.py" -exec echo {} \;

Using sed's `-i` (in-place editing), you can replace text in files:

  find . -name "*.py" -exec sed -i 's/before/after/g' {} \;
