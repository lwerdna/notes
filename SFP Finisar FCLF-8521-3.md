* uses transceiver Marvell 88E1111 [1] (related 88e154x at [2] could be helpful) and is visible after disassembly to determine authenticity
* see application note [3]
* configuration is tunneled over I2C, so the payload of I2C transactions will be interpreted as register access instructions
### EEPROM access
* uses I2C 7-bit 0x50 (0xA0 shifted right once)
* to set internal address pointer, do a single I2C transaction writing a single byte to 0x50 which becomes the EEPROM address
* to read, just do a normal I2C transaction reading N bytes from 0x50
* to write, do a single I2C transaction where the first byte is the address, and the following bytes are the values to be written
* original EEPROM dump: find/sfp_finisar_eeprom.bin

### PHY register access
* PHY area is not readable unless TX_DISABLE is low! tie to ground!
* uses I2C 7-bit 0x56 (0xAC shifted right once)
* set internal address pointer just like with EEPROM, but address now is the register index, so accessing register 2 (PHY Identifier) is done by seeking 2, even though this appears at offset 4, since all registers are two bytes
* to read and write, it's the same as EEPROM access, but to I2C device 0x56
* original PHY dump after power cycle, note the 64 bytes repeat after the 32 registers of 2 bytes each are exhausted
