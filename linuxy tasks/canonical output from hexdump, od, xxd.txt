Get the classic "OHA" (offset, hex, ascii) output:

$ hexdump -C /bin/ls
$ xxd -g 1 /bin/ls
$ od -A x -t x1z -v /bin/ls

For hexdump, "-C" means canonical.
For xxd, "-g 1" means group 1 byte.
For od:
  "-A x" sets address to hex format
  "-t x1" sets type to hex, 1 byte
  "z" displays printable characters at the end of each output line
  "-v" prevents * being used for repeated lines
